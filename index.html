                <br>The ATH-ANC700BT QuietPoint® wireless over-ear headphones combine Audio-Technica’s proprietary active noise-cancelling technology

                <br>play/pause music, and increase and decrease volume; swipe to skip to the next or previous music track. The headphones’ noise-cancelling 
                <br>functionality is driven by a four-microphone (two in each earcup) multi-feedback system for wide-range performance that greatly reduces 
                <br>environmental noise.
